# FAQ & Troubleshooting

## General

### Q: What server software is supported?
**A:** Paper/Purpur 1.21+ (up to 1.21.11 and the year-based 26.1.x–26.2.x releases) and Folia. FPP has full Folia support with region-threaded bot spawning.

### Q: Does it work on Spigot or CraftBukkit?
**A:** No. FPP uses Paper-specific APIs and NMS Mojang-mapped classes.

### Q: What Java version do I need?
**A:** JDK 21+ for both the server and for building from source.

### Q: Can I use this on a server with ViaVersion?
**A:** Yes, but the server itself must be Paper 1.21+ — ViaVersion only affects the *client* versions
that can connect, not the server's own version. If ViaVersion is installed, bots automatically register
themselves with it as running the server's own native protocol version, so Via never treats a bot as an
unrecognized connection (no "can't find version" console warnings).

### Q: How do I see what a bot is doing?
**A:** The nametag above every bot shows its live activity (idle / moving / mining / fighting /
eating / searching / sneaking …), updated twice a second. The `/fpp list` GUI shows the same activity per
bot, and the pathfinding particle debug view (per-bot settings → 🧭 ᴘᴀᴛʜꜰɪɴᴅɪɴɢ → ꜱʜᴏᴡ ᴘᴀᴛʜ, or
globally via `/fpp settings` → 🐛 ᴅᴇʙᴜɢ → ꜱʜᴏᴡ ᴀʟʟ ᴘᴀᴛʜꜱ) renders each bot's route.

### Q: Can I see debug output in-game instead of the console?
**A:** Yes. Enable `debug-chat: true` in `debug.yml` (or via `/fpp settings` → Debug). All debug output will be sent to online players with `fpp.op` or `fpp.notify` as chat messages.

## Bots & Spawning

### Q: Why don't bots show in the tab list or server-list player count?
**A:** By design. Bots are unlisted in the tab, subtracted from the server-list ping count, and
removed from its hover sample. They also earn no advancements and send no join/leave/death chat
messages.

### Q: Bots appear but have no skin.
**A:** Skins come from the rarity pools in `plugins/FakePlayerPlugin/skins/` (`main_skin.txt` +
`1-<N>%.txt` files of NameMC URLs). A fresh skin needs one MineSkin signing round-trip (a few
seconds) the first time it's ever used; after that it's cached forever in `data/skin-cache.yml`.
Enable the `skin-pool` debug topic to trace the pipeline. To disable skins set
`skin.rare-pools: false`.

### Q: I removed a bot's name tag (e.g. with `/kill @e[type=text_display]`) and it came back — why?
**A:** By design. The name tag is a real world entity, so anything that can remove an entity can remove
it — but a self-heal check runs every 10 ticks and respawns it the moment it's gone. There's no way to
make a bot permanently tag-less; the mandatory "ʙᴏᴛ ʙʏ {owner}" disclosure row can't be disabled either.

### Q: How do bot UUIDs work?
**A:** Deterministic and name-derived with a recognizable `fb07` prefix: `bot` →
`fb070000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`, `bot2` → `…-000000000002`; custom names hash into the low
bits. They can never collide with real accounts.

### Q: Spawn cooldown is blocking players.
**A:** Set `spawn-cooldown: 0` in `config.yml` or grant `fpp.bypass.cooldown`.

### Q: "Max bots reached" but I have fewer than the limit.
**A:** The limit is both global (`limits.max-bots`) and personal (`fpp.spawn.limit.N`). Check both.

### Q: Can I spawn several bots at once?
**A:** No — `/fpp spawn` intentionally creates exactly one bot per command (auto-named, or
`--name <name>` for a custom name).

### Q: Can I run `/fpp spawn` from the server console?
**A:** No — `/fpp spawn` is in-game only and always spawns the bot at the commanding player's own
location. There's no world/coordinate targeting either. Console senders get the same "only a player
can run this command" rejection as any other player-only command.

## Tasks, Combat & Pathfinding

### Q: How do I make a bot fight mobs?
**A:** Open its settings (shift+right-click the bot or click it in `/fpp list`) → `🗡 ᴘᴠᴇ` → set
**ꜱᴍᴀʀᴛ ᴀᴛᴛᴀᴄᴋ** to "on" (attack in reach) or "on with movement" (chase via pathfinding). Pick
target mob types, detect range, and priority there too. The **ᴘᴠᴇ ꜱᴛᴀᴛᴜꜱ** tile shows the live
state (off / scanning / fighting).

### Q: Can I make bots pathfind to coordinates or follow players?
**A:** Yes — `/fpp move <bot> --to <bot|player>` follows a target live, and
`/fpp move <bot> --coords <x> <y> <z> [world]` walks to a fixed point. Both are backed by the
core Pathetic A* engine.

### Q: Bot is stuck and won't move.
**A:** The pathfinder auto-recalculates when stuck, and abandons a target after a few fruitless
cycles (`pathfinding.max-stuck-cycles`). Enable the `pathfinding` debug topic for grep-friendly
`event=STUCK/PATH_REJECTED/…` console lines explaining exactly what happened. `/fpp stop <bot>`
cancels everything manually.

### Q: How does `/fpp find` work?
**A:** Search → path → mine loops: it auto-equips the best tool from the bot's inventory, gives up
on unreachable/unbreakable blocks instead of looping, and when inventory runs low it deposits into
the bot's nearest registered storage (`/fpp storage`) before resuming.

### Q: Can a bot do two things at once (mine and fight, walk and use)?
**A:** Yes. Starting a new task (`move` / `find` / `left-click` / `right-click` / `attack`) no longer
stops the bot's other running tasks, and PVE auto-combat always fights back regardless of what else
the bot is doing. The one real limit is movement: a bot has one body, so only one thing can actually be
walking it around at a time. That's arbitrated by priority instead of by cancelling — an explicit
`/fpp move` always wins, a manual task's own walk-to-reach outranks background movement (PVE's chase,
an auto-deposit trip), and whichever loses out just waits its turn instead of hijacking the bot mid-walk.
Two hand-actions aimed at two *different* targets at once will still visibly alternate the bot's aim
between them each tick (one head, one main hand) — that's a real single-body limit, not a bug.

### Q: How do I make a bot eat automatically?
**A:** Open its settings → `🍖 ᴀᴜᴛᴏ-ᴇᴀᴛ`. Toggle **ᴀᴜᴛᴏ-ᴇᴀᴛ** on, set the **ʜᴜɴɢᴇʀ ᴛʜʀᴇꜱʜᴏʟᴅ**
(0-19; the bot eats at or below it), and open **ᴀʟʟᴏᴡᴇᴅ ꜰᴏᴏᴅꜱ** to pick which foods it may eat
(none selected = any food). When hungry the bot prefers food in its off-hand, then hotbar, then
inventory. Eating from the off-hand — the default/preferred source — runs **fully in parallel**: it
doesn't pause mining, moving, or combat at all, the same way a real player can snack on something in
their off-hand mid-task. Only the main-hand fallback (no off-hand food available) still briefly pauses
hand-actions, since it has to borrow the main hand itself for the eat animation. The global default
threshold is `automation.auto-eat-threshold` in `config.yml`.

### Q: My bot flips levers / presses buttons just by looking at the wall they're on.
**A:** Fixed — the bot now must aim at the button/lever's actual hit box to trigger it, exactly like
a real player. Aiming at the block it's mounted on (or a corner of that face) no longer activates
the switch.

### Q: How does the bot decide where to stand for a click?
**A:** If the target is already in reach it clicks from where it is. If not, it walks to a spot it
can reach the target from — preferring **your own standing location** (since you just aimed at the
target from there, it's a provably reachable vantage) before falling back to searching around the
target itself.

## Economy / Rental

### Q: How do I let players pay for bots?
**A:** Set `economy.enabled: true` in `config.yml`, install Vault (or ExcellentEconomy), and set your
prices under `economy.rental.*`. Players then use `/fpp rent buy <hours>` /
`/fpp rent extend <bot> <hours>`. See [Economy](Economy) for full setup.

### Q: Does it work with EssentialsX's/CMI's economy, not just "Vault" the plugin?
**A:** Yes — FPP talks to Vault's `Economy` *service*, which any Vault-compatible plugin (EssentialsX,
CMI, the "Vault2.0" reimplementation, ExcellentEconomy-with-Vault-present, …) registers into. You
don't need the literal Vault.jar specifically as long as something provides that service.

### Q: Can I use my own shop plugin (ShopGUIPlus, EconomyShopGUI, …) instead of FPP's built-in charging?
**A:** Yes — that's exactly what `/fpp rent give <player> <bot|--new> <hours>` is for. It never
touches an economy plugin itself; point your shop's reward/command action at it and your shop plugin
handles the payment however it already does. `economy.enabled` doesn't even need to be `true` for
this path.

### Q: What happens when a rented bot's time runs out?
**A:** It despawns through the same safe path as `/fpp despawn` (inventory/XP saved normally) and the
owner is notified if online. They get a one-time warning `economy.rental.warn-minutes-before-expiry`
minutes beforehand too.

### Q: Can I make specific bots or players exempt from expiring?
**A:** Grant `fpp.rent.unlimited` — that player's rented bots never expire from time running out,
regardless of what `rentalExpiresAt` they were given.

## Database

### Q: Can I use SQLite for a network setup?
**A:** No. SQLite is local-only. Use MySQL for multi-server setups.

### Q: Database connection fails on startup.
**A:** Verify credentials, firewall rules, and that the MySQL user has CREATE/ALTER permissions (schema migrations need them).

## Performance

### Q: Server lag with many bots.
**A:**
- Lower `chunk-loading.radius` or set `mass-disable-threshold` lower
- Reduce `head-ai.tick-rate`
- Increase `performance.position-sync-distance` (or set to `128`)
- Reduce bot count or spawn in batches
- Use `/fpp perf top` / `/fpp perf report` to measure

## Building

### Q: How do I build from source?
**A:** JDK 21+ and `./gradlew clean shadowJar`. The paperweight dev bundle downloads automatically.

### Q: `velocity-companion` or `bungee-companion` build fails.
**A:** These directories are `.gitignored` and may not exist. Only build them if you have the companion source.

## Fall Damage

### Q: Bots take fall damage even with `body.damageable: false`.
**A:** `body.damageable` only controls player/entity damage. Fall damage is governed by `combat.fall-damage.enabled` and is independent. Set `combat.fall-damage.enabled: false` to disable fall damage entirely.
