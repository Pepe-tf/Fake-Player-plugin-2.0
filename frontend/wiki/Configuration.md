# Configuration

Main file: `plugins/FakePlayerPlugin/config.yml`

Run `/fpp reload` to apply most changes without restarting.

## Structure

### `config-version`
Managed automatically by the built-in migrator. **Do not edit.**

### `language`
Default: `en`. Points to `plugins/FakePlayerPlugin/language/<lang>.yml`.

---

## 1. Spawning

### `limits`
- `max-bots: 1000` - global cap (`0` = unlimited)
- `user-bot-limit: 1` - default personal limit for `fpp.use` players
- `spawn-presets: [1, 5, 10, 15, 20]` - tab-complete suggestions for `/fpp spawn`

### `spawn-cooldown`
Seconds between `/fpp spawn` uses. `0` = disabled.

### `persistence`
- `enabled: true` - bots save position on shutdown and rejoin on restart
- `restore-delay-ticks: 0` - delay before restore starts after plugin enable
- `restore-batch-size: 1` - bots restored per batch

### `heartbeat`
- `enabled: true` - controls whether the network heartbeat manager publishes server status

> Note: `join-delay` and `leave-delay` were removed in recent versions.

---

## 2. Appearance

### `bot-name`
- `mode: random` - `random` (generate username) or `pool` (pick from `bot-names.yml`)
- `admin-format: '{bot_name}'` - display name for admin spawns
- `user-format: 'bot-{spawner}-{num}'` - display name for user spawns

### `badword-filter`
- `enabled: true` - block/rename bad names
- `use-global-list: false` - fetch remote profanity list
- `global-list-url: "..."` - remote word list URL
- `global-list-timeout-ms: 5000` - fetch timeout
- `words: []` - inline word list (merged with `bad-words.yml`)
- `whitelist: []` - allowed names even if they match bad words
- `auto-rename: true` - silently rename bad names instead of blocking
- `auto-detection`
  - `enabled: true`
  - `mode: normal` - `off` / `normal` / `strict`

### `bot-interaction`
- `right-click-enabled: true` - right-click opens inventory/executes command
- `shift-right-click-settings: true` - shift+right-click opens bot settings GUI

### `messages`
- `join-message: true` - broadcast join message
- `leave-message: true` - broadcast leave message
- `death-message: true` - broadcast vanilla death message
- `kill-message: false` - broadcast when a real player kills a bot
- `notify-admins-on-join: true` - send compatibility warnings to admins on join

### `metrics`
- `enabled: true` - anonymous FastStats usage statistics

---

## 3. Body & Combat

### `body`
- `pushable: true` - players/explosions can push bots
- `damageable: true` - take all damage (if `false`, still takes environmental)
- `pick-up-items: true`
- `pick-up-xp: true`
- `drop-items-on-despawn: false` - `true` drops inventory on despawn; `false` keeps it

### `combat`
- `max-health: 20.0` - standard player HP
- `hurt-sound: true`
- `fall-damage`
  - `enabled: true`
  - `safe-distance: 3.0` - blocks before damage starts
  - `multiplier: 1.0` - damage scale

### `death`
- `respawn-on-death: false` - respawn at spawn location after death
- `respawn-delay: 1` - ticks before respawn
- `suppress-drops: false` - `true` = suppress all drops

### `skin`
- `rare-pools: true` - enable the rarity skin system (disable = vanilla default Steve/Alex)
- `mineskin-api-key: ''` - optional MineSkin API key (mineskin.org/apikey) for a larger signing quota

Skins are defined in `plugins/FakePlayerPlugin/skins/` as text files of NameMC skin URLs:
`main_skin.txt` is the default every bot spawns with; each `1-<N>%.txt` file is a "1 in N" rarity
pool rolled on fresh spawns (rarest first). Skins are signed once through MineSkin - with the
slim/classic model auto-detected - and cached forever in `data/skin-cache.yml`. A bot keeps its
rolled skin across despawns and restarts; re-roll from the bot's `🎨 ꜱᴋɪɴ` settings category.

### `automation`
Defaults copied to newly spawned bots:
- `auto-eat: true`
- `auto-eat-threshold: 17` - default hunger level (0-19) at or below which a bot eats; per-bot overridable in the settings GUI
- `auto-place-bed: true`
- `auto-milk: true`
- `prevent-bad-omen: true`

### `left-click` / `right-click`
Server-wide default pacing for held `/fpp left-click`/`/fpp right-click` (`--repeat`/`--hold`).
Each bot can override its own interval in the settings GUI (`⚙ ɢᴇɴᴇʀᴀʟ` → ʟᴇꜰᴛ/ʀɪɢʜᴛ-ᴄʟɪᴄᴋ ɪɴᴛᴇʀᴠᴀʟ);
these are only the fallback for bots that haven't been given their own value.
- `left-click.interval-ticks: 4` - ticks between block breaks while `--repeat`/`--hold` mining
  (vanilla's own `destroyDelay` is ~5 ticks; default matches that). Entity attacks are unaffected -
  those are paced solely by the held weapon's real attack-speed cooldown, exactly like a real player.
- `right-click.interval-ticks: 4` - ticks between held right-click pulses (default matches the
  vanilla client's own `rightClickDelay`).
- Both accept 1-40 ticks (enforced per-bot too).

Debug logging is now controlled by `plugins/FakePlayerPlugin/debug.yml` for better organization.

**Master switch:**
- `enabled: false` - Enable all debug categories at once

**Debug chat broadcast:**

**NMS debug:**
- `nms.enabled: false` - General NMS operations
- `nms.bot: false` - Bot lifecycle (spawn, despawn, inventory)
- `nms.connection: false` - Network connection/packet events
- `nms.physics: false` - Physics/collision/knockback
- `nms.skin: false` - Skin fetching and application

**Database debug:**

- `network: false` - Cross-server network (Velocity/BungeeCord)
- `config-sync: false` - Config synchronization

- `rental: false` - Economy provider resolution, every rent purchase/extend/give, and expiry-sweep despawns

> You can toggle any of these at runtime via **`/fpp settings`** → the **🐛 ᴅᴇʙᴜɢ** category. Changes are saved to `debug.yml` immediately. Run `/fpp reload` after manual edits to `debug.yml`.
---

## 10. Economy / Rental

### `economy`
Off by default. See [Economy](Economy) for the full picture (supported providers, custom shop
plugin integration, notifications). Quick reference:
- `enabled: false` - master switch for the self-service `/fpp rent buy`/`extend` purchase path.
  `/fpp rent give` (the console/shop-plugin grant path) works regardless of this setting, since it
  never touches an economy plugin.
- `provider: auto` - `auto` \| `vault` \| `excellenteconomy` \| `none`. `auto` tries Vault first
  (this also covers "Vault2.0" and Vault-bridged ExcellentEconomy automatically), then native
  ExcellentEconomy, then gives up.
- `excellent-economy-currency-id: money` - which ExcellentEconomy currency to charge; only used when
  the resolved provider is ExcellentEconomy (it supports unlimited custom currencies, so there's no
  single fixed default - this must match one you've actually created).
- `rental.price-per-hour: 100.0` - cost per hour of rented bot time.
- `rental.price-per-bot-slot: 0.0` - one-time extra charge for a brand-new rented bot.
- `rental.min-hours: 1` / `rental.max-hours: 72` - bounds on a single buy/extend.
- `rental.max-banked-hours: 168` - hard cap on time a bot can have banked across repeated extensions.
- `rental.warn-minutes-before-expiry: 10` - owner gets a one-time warning this many minutes out (`0` disables).
- `rental.sweep-interval-seconds: 30` - how often the expiry check runs.
- `rental.max-bots-per-player: 3` - cap on rented bots per player (`fpp.rent.unlimited` bypasses this).

---

## 11. Auth

### `auth`
Off by default. Makes bots auto-register/login against an installed login plugin instead of sitting
there unauthenticated - see the [Permissions](Permissions) page for `fpp.auth` and `/fpp auth` on
the [Commands](Commands) page. Needs `database.enabled: true` to remember passwords across joins.
- `enabled: false` - master switch.
- `register-command: "register %password% %password%"` / `login-command: "login %password%"` - sent
  as the bot itself, no leading slash needed. `%password%` is replaced with its generated/remembered
  password. Defaults already match nLogin, AuthMe, LoginSecurity, CrazyLogin, and xAuth.
- `delay-min-ticks: 20` / `delay-max-ticks: 60` - random delay before the command fires, so it
  doesn't fire the instant a bot's connection opens.
- `pending-timeout-ticks: 100` - hard cap on how long a bot stays frozen waiting to detect its own
  register/login outcome; it's released regardless once this elapses.
- `password.length: 12` - generated password length. Stay under your login plugin's max-length
  policy if it has one (some cap around 15).
- `password.uppercase` / `.lowercase` / `.digits` / `.symbols: true` - character classes included in
  a generated password.

All of the above are also editable live from `/fpp settings` → **🔐 ᴀᴜᴛʜ**.

The plugin includes a built-in **ConfigMigrator** that:
1. Creates a timestamped backup before any change
2. Automatically upgrades configs when `config-version` is outdated
3. Removes obsolete keys and adds new defaults

Do **not** edit `config-version` manually.
