> **Advanced NPC / Bot plugin for Paper, Purpur, and Folia 1.21+**

FPP spawns server-side bot entities that behave like real players - useful for **AFK farms,
automated tasks, testing, and NPC simulations**. It is deliberately **not** a fake-online-count or
player-spoofing tool: bots are hidden from the tab list and server-list ping, always wear a
mandatory "ʙᴏᴛ ʙʏ {owner}" nametag, earn no advancements, and can never take a real account's
identity.

## Features

- 💰 **Bot rental economy** - pay real currency (Vault, "Vault2.0", or ExcellentEconomy) for a bot
  and hours of runtime via `/fpp rent buy`/`extend`; auto-despawns the instant paid time runs out.
  `/fpp rent give` needs no economy plugin at all - a zero-integration entry point for wiring up
  your own shop plugin instead. Off by default; see [Economy](frontend/wiki/Economy.md)
- 🧵 **Multitasking** - `move`, `find`, `left-click`, `right-click`, `attack`, and PVE auto-combat can
  all run at once on the same bot instead of one cancelling the others; movement (the one true
  single-body limit) is arbitrated by priority instead of by hijacking
- 🧭 **Real pathfinding engine** - [Pathetic](https://github.com/bsommerfeld/pathetic)-backed A*
  navigation with parkour, block-breaking, bridging, stuck detection with a hard give-up budget,
  pre-flight path verification, and a Baritone-style particle debug view
- 🗡️ **PVE combat** - per-bot smart attack with mob-type selection, detect range, target priority,
  real weapon-cooldown pacing, and pathfinding-linked chasing; always active alongside other tasks
- ⛏️ **Find automation** - `/fpp find` search → path → mine loops with tool auto-equip, anti-stuck
  watchdogs, and inventory-aware deposits into registered storages
- 🎯 **Precise, configurable clicking** - `/fpp left-click` / `/fpp right-click` aim at the **exact
  point** you're looking at, walk to a reachable vantage (preferring your own standing spot) when
  the target is out of reach, and only trigger a button/lever when actually aimed at its hit box;
  the `--repeat`/`--hold` pacing is configurable server-wide and per bot
- 🍗 **Auto-eat** - per bot: eats from its inventory when hungry (off-hand → hotbar → inventory
  priority), with a configurable allowed-food list and hunger threshold; off-hand eating runs fully
  in parallel with everything else, main-hand eating still pauses briefly and resumes afterward
- 🔌 **ViaVersion-aware** - bots register with ViaVersion (if installed) as running the server's own
  native protocol version, so it never treats them as an unrecognized connection
- 🏷️ **Unremovable live nametags** - three-row mannequin-style tag with a real-time activity line
  (idle / moving / mining / fighting / eating / searching / sneaking …); the real over-head name stays
  packet-hidden and self-heals every sweep, and the tag entity itself respawns if ever removed
- 🎨 **Rarity skin pools** - bots roll their skin from configurable rarity tiers
  (`skins/1-<N>%.txt` files of NameMC URLs), signed once via MineSkin and cached forever, with
  slim/classic model auto-detection
- 🆔 **Readable bot UUIDs** - deterministic `fb07…` UUIDs with the bot number embedded
  (`bot2` → `fb070000-…-000000000002`); zero collision risk with real accounts
- 🖥️ **Full GUI suite** - bot list hub (search, sort, live refresh, spawn & settings shortcuts),
  per-bot settings (general, PVE, pathfinding, skin, **auto-eat**, rename, danger), global settings
  with runtime debug toggles, and a categorized help GUI
- 🫥 **Invisible to players** - no tab-list entry, no server-list count/sample entry, no
  advancements, no join/leave/death chat noise
- 💾 **Persistence** - bots, inventories, XP, rentals, and tasks survive restarts (SQLite or MySQL)
- 🌐 **Proxy networks** - Velocity/BungeeCord support with shared MySQL, cross-server placeholders,
  and config sync
- ✅ **Folia support** - full compatibility with Folia's region-threaded architecture
- 🔐 **LuckPerms-faithful permissions** - no hard-coded operator bypasses; every `fpp.*` node
  (including for server operators) is decided purely by your permissions plugin
- 📊 **Performance tooling** - `/fpp perf` dashboard, history, benchmark reports, Spark integration

## Quick Start

1. Drop `fake-player-plugin-<version>-all.jar` into `plugins/` and restart.
2. Grant yourself access: `/lp user <you> permission set fpp.admin true`
3. `/fpp spawn` - spawns one auto-named bot (`bot`, `bot2`, …) at your location.
4. `/fpp spawn --name Miner` - spawns one custom-named bot.
5. `/fpp list` - the GUI hub: click a bot to manage it, spawn more, or open global settings.

Full documentation lives in the [wiki](frontend/wiki/Home.md): commands, permissions,
configuration, placeholders, database/proxy setup, and FAQ.

## Building from Source

Requires **JDK 21+**. The paperweight dev bundle downloads automatically.

```bash
./gradlew clean shadowJar
# → build/libs/fake-player-plugin-<version>-all.jar
```

Run the test suite with `./gradlew test`.

## Deliberately Removed Capabilities

Several capabilities were **intentionally removed** from this codebase and should not be
reintroduced - pull requests restoring them will be declined. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full policy and rationale:

- **Player spoofing / impersonation** - anything that lets a bot pose as a specific real player
  (real-account UUIDs, premium skin/identity lookups by player name, removing the mandatory bot
  nametag, showing bots in the tab list or server-list ping)
- **Bot chat** - bots are fully silent in chat by design
- **The runtime extension/addon loader** - external code cannot be loaded into FPP; integrate from
  a normal Bukkit plugin via the fired `FppBot*` events instead
- **License/DRM checks** - the plugin is open source and runs unconditionally
